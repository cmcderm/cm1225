### Did I use AI for this?
Nope, didn't need it. I tend to reach for AI assistance when I'm dealing with something that I don't understand or know how to do.
Especially in cases where I would prefer to engage in a conversation about execution.
This project was well within what I know how to do, so my references were from simple searches online, no AI needed.

Some things I did look up were how to set up a gradle project, specs for some Java stream methods, and how to work with BigDecimal. None of these were complex enough to require AI.
